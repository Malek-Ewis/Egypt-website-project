				<p> Carb overload coming right at you! Come lunch time in Cairo you'll

					see a stack of locals lined up at every kushari shop around, waiting
			   
					for a hearty portion of one of Egypt's favourite street foods. This
			   
					filling meal is made up of rice, macaroni and lentils, topped with
			   
					tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and fried
			   
					onions. It's a perfect meal that is substantial, nutrient-packed and
			   
					cheap. Exactly what the Egyptians were after!</p>

					<p> Ta’meya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and

						falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. They’re a staple of
				   
						the Egyptian diet, mainly because they’re filling and use
				   
						ingredients that are easily accessible in the country. The ful is
				   
						made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a
				   
						qedra. The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of
				   
						crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste, then fried.
				   
						Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
				   
						Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A
				   
						perfect dish for all you vegos!</p>
